# 22-SecMPC

This code is accompanying the IROS 2022 submission on
*Sequence-of-Constraints MPC: Reactive Timing-Optimal Control of
Sequential Manipulation*.

This repository contains only the methods specific to the concrete
experiments in this paper. The https://github.com/MarcToussaint/botop
repository contains the actual code base, including the general
SecMPC implementation (in src/BotOp/SecMPC). Please install botop in a folder
